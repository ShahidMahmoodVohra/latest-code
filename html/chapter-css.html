<P class="p11">
A <i>Portager</i>  is a French term for anomamental  vegatable or kitchen garden.
Often flowers (edible and non-edible) and herbs are planted with the vegatables
to enhance the garden's beauty.The goal is to make the function of providing
food aesthetically pleasing.</P>

<h2 class="h21">What to plant</h2>   
<p class="p11">
    Plants are chosen as much for their functionality as for their color and 
    form.Many are trained to grow upward. A well-designed potager  can provide
    food, cut flower and herbs for the home with very little maintance. Portager
    can disguise their  function of providing for a home in a wide array of 
    forms-from  the carefree style of the cottage garden to the formality of a 
    knot garden.
