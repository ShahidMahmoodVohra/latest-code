          is an electric piano invented by Harold Rhodes, which became popular in the
          1970s. Like a conventional piano, the Rhodes generates sound with keys and
          hammers, but instead of strings, the hammers strike thin metal tines, which
          vibrate next to an electromagnetic pickup. The signal is then sent through
          a cable to an external keyboard amplifier and speaker.

        <td class="table2"> The Wurlitzer electronic piano is an electric piano
          manufactured and marketed by Wurlitzer from the mid-1950s to the early 1980s.
          Sound is generated by striking a metal reed with a hammer, which induces an
          electric current in a pickup. It is conceptually similar to the Rhodes piano,
          though the sound is different

          The Clavinet is an electrically amplified clavichord invented by Ernst
          Zacharias and manufactured by the Hohner company of Trossingen, West
          Germany, from 1964 to 1982. The instrument produces sounds by a rubber
          pad striking a point on a tensioned string, and was designed to resemble
          the Renaissance-era clavichord.
