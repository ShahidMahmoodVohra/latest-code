<p class="text4">
    The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been
    bred for centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was <br/>
    used by the French Army as sentries, messangers and to search for wounded
    soldiers because of its fine scene of hearing, Braids <br />
    were used in the First World War almost to the point of extinction, Currently
    the population of briards is slowly recovering.<br />
    Charlemangne, Napolean, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.
