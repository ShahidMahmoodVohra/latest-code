        Almost anything can be found in seawater. This includes dissolved
         materials from<br /> Earth's crust as well as materials released 
         from organism. The most important<br />components of seawater that 
         influence life forms are salinity, temperature,<br /> dissolve gases
         (mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutrients,and pH. These <br />
         elements vary in their composition as well as in their influence 
         on marine life.
