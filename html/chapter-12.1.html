    <p>
        The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been
        bred for centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was <br/>
        used by the French Army as sentries, messangers and to search for wounded
        soldiers because of its fine scene of hearing, Braids <br />
        were used in the First World War almost to the point of extinction, Currently
        the population of briards is slowly recovering.<br />
        Charlemangne, Napolean, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.
